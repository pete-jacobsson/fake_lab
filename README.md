 Lab simulation scripts and functions to provide feed for process monitoring development


This project is all about simulating laboratory scenarios with different instruments and different operators introducing additional offsets and uncertainties. In other words, we're simulating labs where things go wrong. Why would we want to do that? Well, one big aspect of maintaining quality is ensuring instrument and operator intercomparison. Bayesian stats offer a great way of doing that, but the models need validated against known inputs - such as the inputs provided by fake_lab.
